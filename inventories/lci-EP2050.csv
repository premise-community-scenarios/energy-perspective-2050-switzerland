We use tap water for now, which is probably wrong. The salt cavern is assumed to be 500,000 m3 large. The available hydrogen amount is 4,000 tons per year, with a lifetime of 40 years, for a total capacity of 6,350 tons per year. Hence the inputs are normalized by 4,000 tons * 40 years.

comment,"LCI of storing 1 kg of hydrogen in a salt cavern. Includes only the electricity to inject the hydrogen in, and pump it out. Some additional parameters: Electricity demand compressor 0.240 kWh/kg H2 (Injection pressure for cavern between 85 and 170 bar. On average 44.25 bar difference of pressure). Electricity demand dryer 0.104 kWh/kg H2 (Hydrogen needs to be dried before reinjection into the pipeline). Lifetime 40 a (Noack et al., 2015; Stolzenburg et al., 2014). Inlet pressure cavern 85 bar. Inlet pressure dryer 50 bar. Electricity demand compressor 0.48 kWh/kg H2 (Injection pressure for pipeline from 50 bar (drier) to 100 bar pipeline).
